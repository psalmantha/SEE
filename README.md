# Sessa Empirical Estimation (SEE)
This repository implements clustering analysis using Sessa Empirical Estimation with K-Means and DBSCAN. It includes a dataset from [CRAN's AdhereR package](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/AdhereR/html/med.events.ATC.html) and a Jupyter Notebook containing the code for preprocessing, clustering, and visualization, as well as the insights for interpreting the results.
