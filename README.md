# Sessa Empirical Estimator (SEE)
This repository implements clustering analysis using the Sessa Empirical Estimator with K-Means and DBSCAN. It uses a dataset from [CRAN's AdhereR package](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/AdhereR/html/med.events.ATC.html) and a Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for preprocessing, clustering, and visualization of event intervals.
